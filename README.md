# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I was given most of the code for a treasure hunt game, which uses an intelligent agent pirate to find the treasure from an 8x8 maze. The project came with pre-written code for the game environment (including the maze structure and movement rules), but I was responsible for designing the learning agent. Specifically, I implemented the qtrain function, which enables the pirate to learn optimal navigation strategies through reinforcement learning. This function allows the agent to explore the environment, store experiences, and improve decision-making over time by adjusting its policy based on rewards.

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists analyze, design, and implement cutting-edge solutions to computational problems that allow technology to progress at an astounding rate. This is an essential role in the modern world, because technology is integrated almost everywhere in every field. 
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into manageable components, looking for patterns, and researching the most effective algorithmic or computational solutions. It is important to approach problems with an open mind, and not be discouraged by apparent difficulty.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsiblities include: 
  Ensuring transparency - Disclosure of how the AI system works via clear documentation is esential.
  Minimizing bias - Utilizing the most accurate and unbiased training data, as well as a diverse team is also necessary.
